# Google Meta Tags

Google supports both page-level meta-tags as well as inline directives to help control how your site's pages will appear in Search.

Page-level meta tags are a great way for webmasters to provide search engines with information about their sites. Meta tags can be used to provide information to all sorts of clients, and each system processes only the meta tags they understand and ignores the rest. Meta tags are added to the `<head>` section of your HTML page and generally look like this:

```html
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Example Books - high-quality used books for children</title>
        <meta name="description" content="This is a description of your website">
    </head>
```

|   Tag | Description  |
|---|---|
| `<meta name="description" content="A description of the page" />` | Use this tag to provide a short description of the page. In some situations this description is used as a part of the snippet shown in the search results. It should be from 120 to 158 characters.|
|  `<title>A title of the page</title>` |  A short description of a webpage. Appears at the top of a browser window and in SERPs. A page title should include a pageâ€™s keyword in the title tag. While there is no character limit to a title tag, it is best practice to stay under 70 characters, which is the optimal length of a title that appears in Google SERPs (search engine result pages)  |
