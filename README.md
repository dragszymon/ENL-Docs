# Enlighten Development

#### 1. Introduction
This is the Enlighten Development Hub. Here we pass on the knowlagde and experience we have collected during the development process of our projects. The goal of this is to have all the information that we have found impornatnt, while developing, in one place. Furthermore, we hope that this documentation will elevate, simplify and accelearte the process of adaptation of our new co-workers. 

Please note that, even though you should write here anything that would be helpfull for you in the future, othere people may find it usefull too. So please write everything in simple, clean and comprahensive way.
